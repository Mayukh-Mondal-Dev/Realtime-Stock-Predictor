### Problem Statement:
The stock market is volatile and unpredictable, making it difficult for investors to make informed decisions about when to buy or sell their investments. There is a need for a real-time stock market predictor that can help investors make better decisions by predicting future stock prices accurately.

### Solution Description:
We propose to build a real-time stock market predictor using machine learning and a React app. The system will collect real-time and historical stock market data from different industries and preprocess the data to remove outliers and missing values. We will then use feature engineering techniques to select the most relevant features that can affect the stock market's performance.

We will train a machine learning model such as LSTM, ARIMA, or Prophet on the preprocessed data to predict future stock prices accurately. The model will be loaded in the React app using TensorFlow.js or PyTorch.js to generate real-time predictions. The app will display interactive charts and graphs that can show the predicted stock prices in real-time.

To ensure that the model is accurate and reliable, we will use cross-validation techniques and evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). We will also test the model on a separate test set to ensure that it can generalize well to new data.

Overall, our real-time stock market predictor will provide investors with a reliable tool that can help them make better-informed decisions about when to buy or sell their investments. By predicting future stock prices accurately, the system can help investors avoid losses and maximize their profits.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
