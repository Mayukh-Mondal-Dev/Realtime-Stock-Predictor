### Problem Statement:
The stock market is volatile and unpredictable, making it difficult for investors to make informed decisions about when to buy or sell their investments. There is a need for a real-time stock market predictor that can help investors make better decisions by predicting future stock prices accurately.

### Solution Description:
We propose to build a real-time stock market predictor using machine learning. The system will collect real-time and historical stock market data from different industries and preprocess the data to remove outliers and missing values. We will then use feature engineering techniques to select the most relevant features that can affect the stock market's performance.

We will train a Deep learning model such as LSTM on the preprocessed data to predict future stock prices accurately. The model will be loaded in the Streamlit app using different modules/Libraries to generate real-time predictions. The app will display interactive charts and graphs that can show the predicted stock prices in real-time.

To ensure that the model is accurate and reliable, we will use cross-validation techniques and evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). We will also test the model on a separate test set to ensure that it can generalize well to new data.

Overall, our real-time stock market predictor will provide investors with a reliable tool that can help them make better-informed decisions about when to buy or sell their investments. By predicting future stock prices accurately, the system can help investors avoid losses and maximize their profits.
